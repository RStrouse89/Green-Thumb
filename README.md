# Green-Thumb
This fun site enables the user to search for the descriptions and nurturing instructions to plants that they may want to incorporate into their gardens or even just learn more about.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio, API's

This project actually stemmed from a hobby of mine, that being my families annual vegetable garden. I at first wanted to design a useful site for crops but since I was also working on my flower beds I decided to focus on this task first! My first step was to find a useful source for my API. Once a suitable source was found I needed to decide what information to properly display that would be the most useful to the user. I made many fetch requests to obtain the plant data  that the user types in as well as the description and nurture instructions for those plants. Then I used a combination of CSS and HTML to make it readable and appealing.

## Optimizations

I think when I find more time I will add a bit more functionality to this project! Such as allowing the user to save certain plants on their local storage and even having a display of all plants of a 'broad' search that the user can then select from. With all the available data contained within the API it may even be beneficial to allow the user to select which information they are looking for specifically versus endless scrolling to find their target information.

## Lessons Learned:

For me, it was very humbling to see the hard work that went into producing the database to even gain access to this data. I took a lot of time reading the documentation just to ensure I pulled the correct information that I was looking for and it took a lot of (embarrassingly unnecessary) time just to get my styling correct to make the site appealing.
